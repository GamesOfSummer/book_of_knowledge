One of the most impirtant and pretvellent things in Javascript

Any JS dev should be able to precisely and elegantly explain what closure is.

Closure - the way to answer it in an interview - when a function remembers it's lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope.

It's two things - lexical scope + the backpack

Closure is even pre-programming or pre-Computer Science - it's lamda calculus. Comes from SCHEME, a functional language. Brenden Eich basically took SCHEME and renamed it Javascript.
