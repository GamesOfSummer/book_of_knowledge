# The Virtual DOM

This is a good question to understand the 'why' you need something like Angular, React, or Vue versus just using vanilla JS.

It's something that at some point, being a front end developer needs to know the why and how it works. Atleast more than a general "yeah I know it's there" sort of answer. Which is never, ever good enough.

THe DOM can get huge. In this day and age, with all the images and fast internet it can get really huge really fast.

A really good answer why the virtual DOM is awesome is it provides a diff against the real DOM, so making updates is fastter. That's a great anwser right there.
