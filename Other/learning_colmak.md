tl;dr â€“ I learn a different keyboard layout â€“ Colemak. I use a tool to only move a few keys around at a time instead of quitting QWERTY cold turkey.

I type on an ErgoDox for my work. I love just about everything about it (save for the hard-to-reach thumb clusters, but everyone complains about that).

That being said, with the Ergodox â€“ I endured about a month of weirdness and awkwardnessâ€¦. to being happier than I was. I would never go back to a regular keyboard. That was the key point for me to even think about learning a new layout.

Enter Colemak. Itâ€™s only half as bad as Dvorak, as only about half the keys move. Your shortcuts like copy and paste donâ€™t move. The allure is just moving your vowels to the homerow, so you do less stretching when you type.

Now enter Tarmak, which makes the process more digestible.

I made the switch over the course of two months. Iâ€™m probably typing at less half speed right now, but the charm of never leaving the home row keeps me there.

What about typing on regular keyboards? This is a big question I often saw asked, as you wonâ€™t always be on your own `board. Now being on the other side, I can confirmâ€¦.. you donâ€™t lose your QWERTY skills. Youâ€™ll be a little awkward for about ten minutes and your old habits will kick in. ðŸ™‚

Below is a blog of my transition steps over the two months. It might be interesting to you if you ever think about making the change.

Update â€“ April 15th 2019 (Tarmak 1)

â€¦I love where the â€˜Eâ€™ key is. It makes so much sense being there.

Update â€“ April 24th 2019 (Tarmak 2)

I really like where the â€˜eâ€™ key is. Still struggling, but I already feel that my typing speed is back up to about half of what it was.

Update â€“ April 29th 2019 (Tarmak 3)

At this point I am halfway to Colemak and many words I only use one or two fingers to leave the home row â€“ and the rest of the time I am dancing right in the middle. Itâ€™s very soothing.

At this point I am still fresh on Tarmak 3, and the r/s being flipped is messing me up, as expected and predicted. As with the last steps, it will start to fade in a few daysâ€¦

Update â€“ May 10 2019(Tarmak 4)

I was starting to memorize where the â€˜Jâ€™ key was, so I decided to move it one last time â€“ to itâ€™s final position next to the â€˜Gâ€™. Using Tarmak the â€˜Jâ€™ key moves a few times, which sounds awful but in practice I handled it fine. Iâ€™m still messing up with the R/S, but the rest of the key from previous steps I have down pat.

Update â€“ May 19th 2019(Tarmak 5)

I had to get into my keyboard settings because of a separate issue with double key presses, so I went ahead and finalized my journey. Final step of Colemak! If anything, the â€˜Pâ€™ key has been my biggest headache. â€˜Râ€™/â€™Sâ€™ can still trip me up, but itâ€™s not as bad as it was last week.

All in all, I am happy with my progress and I do really like how Colemak is laid out. I told myself I would stick with it for at least a month to make my final decision on keeping it or not, but for now, I am content just being that weird person. ðŸ™‚

Update - December 16th 2019

It's been over six months since I have switched.

I think the most interesting part about thee entire ordeal is that when I type on someone else's keyboard, I still can, but it feels so _wrong_. And not liike, wrong like I can't do it. Wrong as in everyone else is typing wrong. 

Why do I need to reach for the 'E' key? Why is the 'T' key a canyon away from the home row? 

I have a mentor talk about how people refuse to change, but if you put them in the situation where they have said skill, it will blow their mind. Ie, taking a regular joe and putting them in the body of an athetic. Imagine how good everything would feel. But most people won't take the effort to make the change.

That's how I feel about Colemak and QWERTY.
