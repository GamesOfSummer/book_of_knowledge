==Summer's Development Tips - Letting Others Know You're Behind!

Did you know that even senior developers get snagged on tasks? It's true! Software development is a hard job of attempting to foresee the future with what (little) information you have at the time. Ie, 'yes I can get this page done' in a few hours, or 'I can fix the SEO' this week, etc etc

And guess what. You can get 'snagged', a term for when a task you thought would take four hours of work suddenly explodes into _days_ of work.

What can you do? Work overtime? Stop sleeping?

Nope! You simply let your team know that you might be going over. You ask for help. You cut the task down into multiple tasks. But the instant you realize you are going to break your timebox, you let someone know what's going on. That's the key here.

Yes, you might be asked to make up for it. But you also can just push your other tasks into a future sprint of work - allowing you to write amazing, clean code that is maintainable for the work at hand.

Perception is everything in our career path. And having a great perception is admitting when you're stuck, asking for help, and getting the solution as a team.

As a great mentor of mine once said, "there is always a solution!"
