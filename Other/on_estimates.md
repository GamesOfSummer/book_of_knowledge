Estimates are hard. 

* You can estimate stuff you know.
* You can kinda estimate for stuff you know you don't know.
* It's basically impossible to estimate stuff you don't know that you don't know.

Estimates can literally be different depending on your current mood. It's not a science.

Estimates are judgement based, and they can suffer from things like wishful thinking, anchoring, planning, fallacy, and cognitive dissonsance.

There is nothing wrong with making all tasks minor 4 hours, because -

* Designing the thing
* Doing the thing
* Fixing bugs in the thing
* Unit Tests
* PR Review/Code Review
* Dealing with feedback from PR/CR
* QA finds something wrong and you need to fix it

Anything bigger than 3 days of work probably needs to be broken done. If it's unknown, that's bad.
