

I honestly interview with a "do I like the person in front of me" more than what they are currently capable of. Training up is fine. Dealing with someone toxic is not.

Paraphrasing from Joel Spolsky's Guerrilla interviewing - 
* Start with a phone interview first. You'll take very few candidates past this point.
 * You have three minutes after the interview to make the decision of hire or no hire.
 * If you are wishy washy about it, then DO NOT HIRE.
 * If you think "hire, but not for my team" - DO NOT HIRE.
 * If the person is smart and gets things done, hire. You'll know when you find them.

Good candidates -

* Curiosity
* Ability to learn
* Ability to listen


A good way to interview - ask the candidate about what they did at their last job. Keep pushing on the technologies they were using to see if they truly understand what they are using.

Also - push them to a point where they shouldn't have an answer to something. If they say "I don't know", that's great! If they bullshit you, abort the interview.
