## Things that are bad in development shops

One or two of these things is fine, or is a fact of life. If your company is doing most of these....well..... 

* No unit tests
* No QAs
* No BAs/PMs
* No CI/CD
* Thinking that production and the QA environments are the same - spoilers they never, EVER are.
* Very reactionary development - customer wants something, everything gets dropped and devs scramble to get things in place
* No timeline for the next year
* Things that need to be done get pushed repeatedly in favor of 'new' things
* No time for upgrades (until something breaks)
* Having a short dev cycle before release - if coupled with churn from no CI/CD, you are murdering your devs
* Too many leaders - ie, a top dog can just go to a dev and demand something 
* Toxic people/slugs and the company can't/won't fire them
