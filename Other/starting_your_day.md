## Everyday

* Write down a few things you want to get done today. Plan for 2-3 hours of real dev time.

* Write down something you want to spend 20-30 minutes on for R+D. Don't be afraid to dig deeper if you need.

* Set a pomodoro timer. Do this all day.

## Goals

Managing your scope and workload well. Points out wastes of time and encourages you to fix them. Programming is a draining job - you can't code for 8 hours straight. No one can without serious diminishing returns that will call for rewrites later.

Staying ahead of the team in some way - some tech stack, some update, something you can help the team with later down the road. Being an expert in 2-3 months - ahead of the current leads - is what your daily rituals will produce.
